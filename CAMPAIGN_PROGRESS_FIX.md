# Campaign Progress Fix

## Issue Description

The SMS campaign system had a critical bug where campaign progress could exceed 100%, causing validation errors and system instability. The logs showed errors like:

```
Error: SmsCampaign validation failed: progress: Path `progress` (290) is more than maximum allowed value (100).
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Progress Calculation Bug**
- Progress was calculated as `(sentCount + failedCount) / contactCount * 100`
- No bounds checking was applied, allowing progress to exceed 100%
- Campaigns could continue processing messages even after completion

### 2. **Race Conditions**
- Multiple messages were processed simultaneously
- Campaign counters were incremented without checking completion status
- No atomic updates for campaign completion

### 3. **Missing Completion Checks**
- The system didn't prevent processing messages for completed campaigns
- Progress updates continued even after campaigns reached 100%

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Progress Bounds Checking**

**Before:**
```typescript
const newProgress = campaign.contactCount > 0 ? 
  Math.round((totalProcessed / campaign.contactCount) * 100) : 0;
```

**After:**
```typescript
const maxProgress = Math.min(totalProcessed, campaign.contactCount);
const newProgress = campaign.contactCount > 0 ? 
  Math.round((maxProgress / campaign.contactCount) * 100) : 0;
const boundedProgress = Math.min(newProgress, 100);
```

### 2. **Campaign Status Filtering**

Added filtering to only process messages from active campaigns:

```typescript
// Get active campaigns (not completed or paused)
const activeCampaigns = await SmsCampaign.find({
  status: { $in: ['draft', 'sending'] }
}).select('_id').lean();

// Only process messages from active campaigns
const queuedMessages = await SmsMessage.find({
  status: 'queued',
  retryCount: { $lt: 3 },
  $or: [
    { campaignId: { $in: activeCampaignIds } },
    { campaignId: null } // Single SMS messages
  ]
});
```

### 3. **Atomic Updates**

Replaced `.save()` with atomic `findByIdAndUpdate()` operations:

```typescript
// Use atomic update to prevent race conditions
await SmsCampaign.findByIdAndUpdate(campaignId, {
  status: 'completed',
  completedAt: new Date(),
  progress: 100
});
```

### 4. **Enhanced Completion Logic**

```typescript
// Skip if campaign is already completed or paused
if (campaign.status === 'completed' || campaign.status === 'paused') {
  return;
}

// Check completion based on total processed vs contact count
if (totalProcessed >= campaign.contactCount) {
  // Mark as completed
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`ovo/src/lib/services/SmsQueueService.ts`**
   - Added progress bounds checking
   - Enhanced campaign completion logic
   - Added campaign status filtering
   - Implemented atomic updates

2. **`ovo/scripts/fix-campaign-progress.js`**
   - Cleanup script for existing problematic campaigns
   - Fixes campaigns with progress > 100%
   - Marks completed campaigns properly

## Data Cleanup

### Running the Fix Script

```bash
cd ovo
node scripts/fix-campaign-progress.js
```

### What the Script Does

1. **Identifies Problem Campaigns**: Finds campaigns with progress > 100%
2. **Recalculates Progress**: Uses correct bounds checking
3. **Marks Completed Campaigns**: Sets status to 'completed' where appropriate
4. **Provides Statistics**: Shows before/after summary

### Expected Output

```
📊 Connected to MongoDB
🔍 Found 5 campaigns with progress > 100%

🔧 Fixing campaign: Test Campaign (685860592ba13bb3e98321b4)
   Current progress: 292%
   Contact count: 100
   Sent: 85, Failed: 15
   ✅ Marking as completed with 100% progress

✅ Fixed 5 campaigns
🎯 Marked 3 campaigns as completed
🎉 All campaigns now have valid progress values!
```

## Prevention Measures

### 1. **Schema Validation**
Consider adding MongoDB schema validation:

```javascript
db.smscampaigns.createIndex(
  { "progress": 1 },
  { 
    partialFilterExpression: { 
      "progress": { $gte: 0, $lte: 100 } 
    } 
  }
)
```

### 2. **Unit Tests**
Add tests for edge cases:
- Campaign with 0 contacts
- Campaign reaching exactly 100%
- Concurrent message processing

### 3. **Monitoring**
Set up alerts for:
- Campaigns with progress > 100%
- Long-running campaigns
- High failure rates

## Performance Impact

### Before Fix
- Continuous validation errors
- Wasted processing cycles
- Database performance degradation
- User interface showing incorrect progress

### After Fix
- Clean progress calculations
- Proper campaign completion
- Reduced database load
- Accurate real-time updates

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create test campaigns** with various contact counts
2. **Monitor progress updates** during message processing
3. **Verify completion logic** when campaigns finish
4. **Test concurrent processing** with multiple campaigns

## Future Improvements

1. **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time progress updates to frontend
2. **Batch Processing**: More efficient message handling
3. **Rate Limiting**: Better provider quota management
4. **Analytics**: Campaign performance metrics
